# Sorting visualizer

In progress...

This web app lets you select which algorithm you want to visualize as well as the size of the array you want to sort.  
Then, you can start the process, and see each step that the algorithm performs. This allows you to understand better how each algorithm works, and its specificities.

It was built using VueJS 3, JS, SCSS. I also used Pinia as the store to share data between Vue components, as well as the localStorage API to keep some parameters for the next visit.
